*Perfect Partner* is an exploratory narrative-based game that sits in the psychological thriller genre. *Perfect Partner* takes players on the wild ride of experiencing betrayal in a futuristic world after having been cheated on, being fueled with rage to get back at your husband and ordering a “Perfect Partner,” and the eerie realization that getting everything you ever wanted from a partner might be more haunting than it is comforting. *Perfect Partner* takes everything to the extreme, and really pushes players to question whether sometimes “evil” actions actually are indicative of an evil person, or a broken person. Empathy is an emotion we draw on in *Perfect Partner* and we carefully crafted text and character interactions in a manner where it is difficult to pinpoint the often radical main character as the villain in the story. *Perfect Partner* is a psychological thriller that will leave you with more insight into concepts of responsibility, commitment, rage, and desire.
